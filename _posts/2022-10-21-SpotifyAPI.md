## Introduction
I love music. I grew up listening to classic and progressive rock with my dad, and singing with my family in a church choir. My grandma taught me piano and I started with the trumpet in grade school.
Music continues to be a part of my life, if right now only passively. I have a Spotify premium account, and have paid for an app that keeps track of and displays my Spotify data in a very comprehensive way.
Some people enjoy seeing their Spotify Wrapped once a year; I need 10 times that much data every day. With the help of the _Spotipy_ Python module and Spotify's API, I can now make that happen for myself, 
and I'll teach you how.

## APIs and _Spotipy_
Getting data from the internet has endless possibilities. Web scraping makes it possible to most medium-scale data retrievals for your projects.
Possible doesn't always mean easy, and since Spotify is a paid service, restrictions exist to make it difficult to scrape data from your own Spotify account.
Thankfully Spotify has a [proprietary API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) providing dozens of commands to get different data on all things Spotify.
With this API you can formulate GET requests to retrieve data about playlists, artists, songs, etc. How convenient!

That's not even the best part. Sometimes those GET requests can get tricky to formulate exactly, and authentication can be a complicated mess. 
With the [_Spotipy_](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/master/) Python library, you can query Spotify's API with Python functions and get data in dictionary type. 
This is how I set it up: 



## Conclusion
This tutorial was likely insufficient to teach the in depth features of what the Simplex method does, or how to use SciPy’s optimize.linprog method, so if you’re interested in implementing linear optimization into your work, I would recommend diving deeper into understanding the linear constraints and objective function. I hope you enjoy optimization as much as I do, and I challenge you to not only try optimization in Python but also in your daily life - breaking down decisions into logical pieces can sometimes be very useful.
