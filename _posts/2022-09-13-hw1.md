# Starting out

### Why I started blogging
##### Disclaimer: I was prompted to begin because of a homework assignment

When I turned 14 years old I started high school, and started doing a few things differently.
One of them was that I started running and ran a half marathon with my dad.

Another was that I got a Nexus 7 tablet and started writing an electronic journal. I kept it daily without fail until I was 20 (when I started dating the woman who would become my wife). 
I may not record all of the events of my day in narrative form anymore, but I know how important it is to have a record. So here is my record.

### Something interesting

I spent **a lot** of time with pandas this summer for my internship (details about that can come later). I thought I learned pretty much every function,
but today while I was doing a lab for one of my math classes, I was taught a plethora of new and _extremely useful_ functions such as [pd.cut](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.cut.html) 
and [pd.pivot_table](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.pivot_table.html).

Lesson of the week: You really don't know what you don't know! Learning something new can be fast and revolutionary.

Thanks for reading,

Neil
