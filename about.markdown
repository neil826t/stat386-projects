# About Me - Neil Thompson

I am a senior at BYU studying Applied and Computational Mathematics, as well as Statistics.
I am currently working as a Data Scientist for e-Telequote Insurance, Inc, focusing in marketing and sales optimization with big data as well as improving data infrastructure in a small to mid-size company whose data science team is brand new.  
I love data and numbers and math and solving problems, as do many people who call themselves data scientists. I believe that data can and should be used for good, but data alone isn't enough to bring peace and fulfillment to people's lives, so I try to do that in other ways as well.

Feel free to share this blog with anyone, and email me at neil826t@gmail.com with any curiosities, connections, or content suggestions.
